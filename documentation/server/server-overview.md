# Food Ordering Application - Server
## Overview

The server for the Food Ordering Application is a Node.js application responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the PostgreSQL database, and managing the backend logic for user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and more. This document provides an overview of the server setup, API endpoints, middleware, and development process.

## Technologies Used

    Node.js: The server runtime environment.
    Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
    PostgreSQL: The relational database management system.
    Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction.
    Passport.js: Authentication middleware for user authentication.
    Postman: API development and testing tool.

## Setup

    Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.
    Create a new directory for the server and navigate to it in the terminal.
    Initialize a new Node.js project: npm init -y
    Install required packages: npm install express sequelize pg sequelize-cli passport passport-local bcrypt

## API Endpoints

API routes are defined in the apiRoutes.js file within the routes folder. They are responsible for handling various requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and sending responses. The server uses the Express.js framework to set up and manage these routes.

### Authentication

User authentication is managed using Passport.js middleware. The authMiddleware.js file within the middleware folder handles user authentication and session management.

### Database Interaction

Sequelize is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database. The models folder contains model definitions for users, dishes, orders, reviews, and contact requests. These models define the schema and relationships between tables.

## Development Process

1. Set up the server environment, including Express.js, Sequelize, and Passport.js.
2. Create API routes in the apiRoutes.js file to handle different functionalities.
3. Implement route controllers within the controllers folder to handle route logic.
4. Define middleware functions, such as authentication middleware, for route protection.
5. Develop the necessary database models in the models folder using Sequelize.
6. Test API endpoints using Postman to ensure proper functionality.
7. Implement error handling, validation, and response formatting for consistent user experience.

## Conclusion

The server serves as the backend infrastructure for the Food Ordering Application, managing API endpoints, authentication, database interactions, and server-side logic. With Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and Passport.js, the server delivers a secure and reliable platform for users to interact with the application, place orders, leave reviews, and engage with the restaurant's services.
